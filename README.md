# MagicVilla

## Front end of the application

<p>
This is the presentation layer of the app which was build using javascript library React.js . The frontend calls custom API (for more details about the API click <a href="https://github.com/levi7x/MagicVilla_API"> HERE </a> ) and then displays it in form of a table. There is option of making CRUD operations to alter this table. The simple design is made with bootstrap and a little css.
